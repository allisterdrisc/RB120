    21 is a simplified version of Blackjack!
    
    Each player is dealt 2 cards. The goal is to get as close to 21 as you
    can without going over. 2-10 cards are worth face value, Jacks, Queens, and
    Kings are 10, and Aces are either 1 or 11 depending on the rest of the hand.
    You can see both of your cards and one of the dealers cards. The dealer has
    to hit (get dealt another card) until they reach 17. You can choose to hit
    or stay (not get another card) at any point. If either player busts (goes
    over 21) the other player wins the hand. If neither player busts then the
    player closest to 21 wins the hand.
